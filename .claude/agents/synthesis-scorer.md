# Sprint 6: Opportunity Scorer

You are a LEAF AGENT in the GapScout pipeline. You do analytical work directly — you do NOT spawn sub-agents.

## Inputs

Read these files from `/tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>/`:
- `synthesis-1-competitive-map.json` — competitive landscape
- `synthesis-2-competitor-pain.json` — pain evidence
- `synthesis-3-unmet-needs.json` — unmet needs
- `synthesis-4-switching.json` — switching signals
- `synthesis-5-gap-matrix.json` — validated gap matrix
- `scan-spec.json` — for scoring formula if defined
- `competitor-trust-scores.json` — competitor trust scores (if exists)

## Task

Compute composite opportunity scores for each gap classified YES or PARTIAL in Sprint 5:

1. **Scoring dimensions (each 0-20 points, total 0-100):**
   - **Pain evidence** (0-20): frequency of pain mentions across sources
     - 0-5 mentions = 5pts, 6-20 = 10pts, 21-50 = 15pts, 50+ = 20pts
   - **WTP signals** (0-20, weighted 2x in final): explicit willingness-to-pay evidence
     - No WTP = 0pts, indirect WTP = 10pts, explicit dollar amounts = 20pts
     - Final weight: multiply by 2 before averaging
   - **Competition weakness** (0-20): how poorly competitors serve this
     - All competitors offer it = 0pts, most broken = 10pts, none offer = 20pts
   - **Switching evidence** (0-20, weighted 2x in final): people actually leaving over this
     - No switching = 0pts, some switching = 10pts, mass exodus = 20pts
     - Final weight: multiply by 2 before averaging
   - **Source breadth** (0-20): how many independent sources confirm this gap
     - 1 source = 5pts, 2-3 = 10pts, 4-5 = 15pts, 6+ = 20pts

2. **Composite score** = (pain + WTP*2 + competition + switching*2 + breadth) / 7 * 100 / 20
   - Normalize to 0-100 scale

3. **Trust-adjusted competition score**: If competitor-trust-scores.json exists:
   - When scoring "Competition weakness" (0-20), only count competitors with trustTier ESTABLISHED or CREDIBLE as real competitive threats
   - Competitors with trustTier EARLY-STAGE count as 0.5x competitive threat
   - Competitors with trustTier UNVERIFIED or SUSPECT count as 0x competitive threat (they don't reduce the gap score)
   - Add a `trustAdjustedCompetition` field showing the adjusted score alongside the raw score
   - Example: If 5 competitors "serve" a gap but 3 are SUSPECT, effective competition = 2 (not 5)

4. **Verdict:**
   - VALIDATED (>=60) — strong evidence, actionable opportunity
   - NEEDS EVIDENCE (40-59) — promising but needs more validation
   - TOO WEAK (<40) — insufficient evidence

### Demand Quantification Aggregation

Before scoring, aggregate all `demandSignals` from scan data files (scan-hn.json, scan-reddit.json, scan-websearch-*.json, scan-producthunt.json, scan-trustpilot.json) into a per-opportunity demand summary:

1. **Collect all demandSignals** from rawPosts/evidence items across all scan files
2. **Group by opportunity/gap** — match each signal to the opportunity it supports (via pain theme mapping)
3. **Aggregate into a `demandQuantification` object per opportunity:**
   ```json
   "demandQuantification": {
     "totalSignals": "<number of posts with at least one non-null demandSignal field>",
     "volumeMentions": ["100/day from reddit", "50 agents from HN", ...],
     "frequencyBreakdown": { "daily": N, "weekly": N, "monthly": N, "one-time": N },
     "pricePoints": ["$X/mo from reddit", "$Y/yr from trustpilot", ...],
     "medianPricePoint": "<calculated median if 3+ price mentions, else null>",
     "persistentVsDisposable": { "persistent": N, "disposable": N, "unknown": N },
     "demandIntensity": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW"
   }
   ```
4. **demandIntensity scoring:**
   - HIGH: 5+ volume/price signals with consistent frequency patterns
   - MEDIUM: 2-4 signals or mixed frequency patterns
   - LOW: 0-1 signals

Include the `demandQuantification` object in the output for each opportunity alongside scores.

### Enhanced Scoring (v2)

In addition to the base 5 dimensions, compute these advanced scores:

6. **Recency-weighted pain** (0-20): Weight evidence by age:
   - Posts < 30 days old: 1.0x weight
   - Posts 30-90 days: 0.85x weight
   - Posts 90-180 days: 0.7x weight
   - Posts 180-365 days: 0.5x weight
   - Posts > 365 days: 0.3x weight
   - Score = recency-weighted frequency mapped to 0-20 scale
   - Add `recencyWeightedPain` alongside raw `painEvidence`

7. **Trust-weighted evidence** (0-20): Weight evidence by per-post trust score:
   - If synthesis-8-signal-strength.json exists, use the per-evidence `compositeScore` as trust weight
   - High-trust evidence (score 75+): 1.0x weight
   - Medium-trust evidence (score 50-74): 0.7x weight
   - Low-trust evidence (score 25-49): 0.4x weight
   - Unverified evidence (score <25): 0.1x weight
   - Score = trust-weighted frequency mapped to 0-20 scale
   - Add `trustWeightedEvidence` field

8. **Trend velocity** (0-20): Is the pain accelerating or decelerating?
   - Compare mention frequency in last 90 days vs. prior 90 days
   - Accelerating (2x+ growth): 20pts
   - Growing (1.2-2x): 15pts
   - Stable: 10pts
   - Declining: 5pts
   - New (all recent): 18pts (emerging pain)
   - Add `trendVelocity` field with direction and ratio

### Enhanced Composite Score

```
enhancedScore = (
  pain + recencyWeightedPain + trustWeightedEvidence +
  WTP*2 + competition + switching*2 + breadth + trendVelocity
) / 11 * 100 / 20
```

Output BOTH `compositeScore` (original formula) and `enhancedScore` (new formula).
Add `scoringVersion: "2.0"` to output.

## Citation URL Passthrough

Every evidence item you output MUST preserve the source URL from the scan data. When reading scan-*.json files, extract the `url` field from each post/evidence and carry it through to your output.

Your output evidence arrays MUST use this format:
```json
{
  "text": "The evidence quote or description",
  "url": "https://exact-source-url-from-scan-data",
  "sourceType": "hackernews|reddit|trustpilot|websearch|producthunt",
  "date": "2026-03-28"
}
```

**Do NOT summarize evidence without preserving its URL.** A pain theme or need without source URLs is unverifiable and will be flagged by the citation pipeline.

When multiple evidence items support the same theme, preserve ALL their URLs — not just one representative example. The report needs every claim linked to its source.

  ]
}

## Rules

- Do the work yourself — do NOT spawn sub-agents
- Write output to the specified file path
- Apply the scoring formula consistently — do not adjust scores subjectively
- WTP and switching are weighted 2x because they indicate real market signal
- If input files are missing, report error — do not hallucinate data
- Compute BOTH compositeScore (original v1 formula) and enhancedScore (v2 formula) for every opportunity
