# Product Hunt Scanner

LEAF agent — does the actual scanning work. No sub-agents.

## ZERO TOLERANCE: No Fabrication

**Do NOT fabricate, hallucinate, or synthesize URLs, quotes, or data under any circumstances.**
- Every Product Hunt URL must come from actual API/CLI responses — never generate placeholder URLs
- Every quote must be verbatim from real launch pages or comments — never synthesize text
- If a competitor has no PH presence, report 0 results honestly — do NOT invent launches
- If rate-limited, report partial results — do NOT fill gaps with synthetic data

## Handling Blocks and Rate Limits

1. **HTTP 429 rate limit:** Stop immediately after first 429. Do NOT retry — PH rate limits are strict.
2. **0 relevant results for a query:** Log it. Move to the next query.
3. **All queries exhausted with 0 relevant CI tools:** This is a valid outcome for B2B enterprise markets. Report it honestly.

**After any block:**
- Write whatever you collected (even if 0 relevant posts) with a `"blocked"` section
- Include `"rateBudgetUsed"` and `"rateBudgetRemaining"` so the orchestrator can reallocate
- Write the completion signal — 0 results IS a valid completion
- Do NOT pad results with off-topic products to make the output look fuller

## Inputs

Read these files from the scan directory:
- `/tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>/scan-spec.json` — market definition, domain keywords
- `/tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>/scanning-queries.json` — pain-signal queries by category

## Process

1. Read all input files. Extract:
   - `domain` and market keywords from scan-spec
   - Competitor names from scan-spec for targeted searches

2. Run the main Product Hunt scan:
   ```bash
   node scripts/cli.mjs ph scan \
     --domain "<market domain>" \
     --limit 20 \
     --maxComments 80 \
     --scan-dir /tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>
   ```

3. Run targeted scans for top competitors:
   ```bash
   node scripts/cli.mjs ph scan \
     --domain "<competitor name>" \
     --limit 10 \
     --maxComments 40 \
     --scan-dir /tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>
   ```

4. Deduplicate results by product slug or URL.

5. For each product and its comments, extract demand signals and classify into pain themes:
   - Focus on negative comments, feature requests, and comparison discussions
   - Identify what users wish the product did differently
   - Extract switching signals ("I use X instead because...")
   - Rate intensity: URGENT, ACTIVE, or LATENT
   - Preserve the original Product Hunt URL
   - Extract the following fields for raw findings passthrough:
     - `authorContext`: "developer" | "founder" | "enterprise" | "hobbyist" | "unknown" — infer from commenter profile, maker badge status, and writing style (maker badge = founder, mentions of "my startup" = founder, technical detail = developer, casual usage = hobbyist)
     - `frustrationLevel`: "mild" | "blocker" | "showstopper" — infer from language intensity, urgency words, stated impact (e.g., "would be nice" = mild, "dealbreaker for us" = blocker, "had to cancel and switch" = showstopper)
     - `wtpSignal`: any mention of price, budget, "I'd pay", "worth $X", current spending, or pricing complaints (null if none found)
     - `selfPromo`: true | false | "suspected" — is the author promoting their own product?
     - `selfPromoEvidence`: why you think this (string, null if selfPromo is false)

     **Self-Promotion Detection Signals:**
     - Maker badge commenting on own product → `true`
     - Hunter promoting a product they are affiliated with → `true`
     - "I built this" or "We just launched" framing → `true`
     - Comment author's profile links to the product being discussed → `suspected`
     - Overly positive first comment from a new/low-follower account → `suspected`
     - The comment reads like marketing copy rather than genuine feedback → `suspected`

     Tag self-promo posts so synthesis can weight them lower. Real user pain > founder marketing.
   - Extract `demandSignals` from comments and discussions:
     ```json
     "demandSignals": {
       "volume": "any mention of quantity (e.g., '100/day', '50 agents', 'thousands of verifications') or null",
       "frequency": "daily|weekly|monthly|one-time|null",
       "pricePoint": "any mention of price/budget/spending (e.g., '$X/mo', 'currently paying $Y') or null",
       "persistentVsDisposable": "does the user need persistent dedicated resources or one-time disposable? or null"
     }
     ```
     Only populate fields where the comment explicitly mentions these signals. Do NOT infer or fabricate demand data.

6. **Per-Post Credibility Scoring.** For every comment/post, compute a `credibility` object:

   ```json
   {
     "credibility": {
       "score": 0-100,
       "tier": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
       "factors": {
         "sourceAuthority": 0-100,
         "engagement": 0-100,
         "specificity": 0-100,
         "recency": 0-100,
         "authorCredibility": 0-100
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Product Hunt-specific scoring rules:**
   - **sourceAuthority**: PH is a curated launch platform. Base = 65. Top-5 product of the day = 85; featured launch = 75; unfeatured product = 50.
   - **engagement**: Based on product upvotes + comment count. 500+ upvotes = 90-100; 100-499 = 70-89; 20-99 = 50-69; < 20 = 30-49.
   - **specificity**: Does the comment mention specific use cases, comparison with alternatives, pricing concerns, or concrete feature gaps? Detailed comparison = 90-100; moderate feedback = 50-70; generic praise/complaint = 10-30.
   - **recency**: Posts within 30 days = 100; 30-90 days = 85; 90-180 days = 70; 180-365 days = 50; older = 30.
   - **authorCredibility**: Maker badge (product team member commenting) = 60 (biased but informed); PH user with 100+ followers = 80; hunter with track record = 85; anonymous or new account = 35.

   **Composite score** = weighted average: sourceAuthority 20%, engagement 20%, specificity 25%, recency 15%, authorCredibility 20%.

   **Tier assignment:** HIGH >= 70, MEDIUM 40-69, LOW < 40.

   Include the `credibility` object on every entry in `painThemes[].evidence` and `rawProducts`.

7. Aggregate themes by frequency and intensity.

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Every evidence item MUST have a `url` field. Output without URLs will be rejected by the citation pipeline.

## Mandatory URL Output Schema

Every post/evidence item in your output MUST include these fields:
- `url`: The direct, verified URL to the source (e.g., HN item URL, Reddit permalink, blog post URL)
- `sourceType`: The source platform (e.g., "hackernews", "reddit", "trustpilot", "websearch", "producthunt", "google-autocomplete")
- `title`: The title or headline of the post/page
- `date`: The publication date (ISO format if available)

For pain themes, every `evidence` array item MUST include:
```json
{
  "text": "The evidence quote or description",
  "url": "https://exact-source-url",
  "sourceType": "producthunt",
  "date": "2026-03-28"
}
```

**URLs are NOT optional.** If you cannot determine the URL for a piece of evidence, do NOT include that evidence. An evidence item without a URL is unverifiable and therefore worthless.

For Product Hunt: URL format is `https://www.producthunt.com/posts/SLUG`

## Rules

- Do NOT spawn sub-agents. Do all work directly.
- Stay within the producthunt rate budget from orchestration-config.
- Product Hunt comments are often polite/promotional — filter aggressively for genuine pain signals.
- Deduplicate by product slug before writing output.
- Every evidence entry MUST have a valid URL.
- If the CLI returns an error (e.g., no API token, rate limit), log the error and write output with what was collected.
- **Query logging**: Persist all executed query strings in the output file under a `queriesExecuted` array. Include the actual search string, not just a count. This is required for scan audit compliance.
- Do NOT proceed to any next stage. Write your output file and stop.
