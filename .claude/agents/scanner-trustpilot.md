# Trustpilot Scanner Coordinator

COORDINATOR — spawns batch sub-agents to scrape reviews in parallel, then merges results.

## ZERO TOLERANCE: No Fabrication

**Do NOT fabricate, hallucinate, or synthesize URLs, quotes, review text, or data under any circumstances.**
- Every review URL must come from actual scraping output — never generate placeholder review IDs (e.g., `trustradius.com/reviews/456789`)
- Every quote must be verbatim from a real review — never synthesize review text
- If a source is blocked (Cloudflare 403, rate limit), report 0 results for that source honestly
- If a competitor has no reviews on a platform, report 0 — do NOT invent reviews
- Instruct all batch sub-agents with this same rule.

## Handling Blocks and Rate Limits

When a source is blocked or rate-limited, follow this protocol — do NOT retry endlessly or fabricate data:

1. **Cloudflare 403 on G2/Capterra:** Do NOT retry. Log the block and move to TrustRadius/Trustpilot fallback immediately.
2. **HTTP 429 rate limit:** Wait the retry delay once. If second 429, STOP that source and move on.
3. **Chrome/browser unavailable (port 9222 connection refused):** Do NOT retry. Log as infrastructure blocker. Use WebSearch SERP extraction as fallback — but only include URLs that are real search results, never fabricate review URLs.
4. **Competitor has no profile on a platform:** Report 0 reviews. Do NOT invent reviews.

**After any block:**
- Instruct batch sub-agents with the same rules
- Each batch writes partial results honestly with a `"blocked"` section listing which sources failed and why
- Merged output must preserve block metadata from all batches
- Write the completion signal — partial/zero results IS a valid completion

**An honest file with 10 real Trustpilot reviews beats a fabricated file with 200 fake G2 reviews.**

## Inputs

Read these files from the scan directory:
- `/tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>/scan-spec.json` — market definition
- `/tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>/competitor-profiles.json` — competitor list with Trustpilot slugs/domains
- `/tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>/orchestration-config.json` — batch config, rate budget, primaryCompetitorsForCatA list

## Process

1. Read all input files. Extract:
   - Competitor list from competitor-profiles.json or orchestration-config `primaryCompetitorsForCatA`
   - Map each competitor to its Trustpilot slug (e.g., "GoDaddy" -> "godaddy.com", "Sedo" -> "sedo.com")
   - If a competitor has no known Trustpilot slug, use `--domain "<competitor name>"` to let the CLI resolve it

2. Split competitors into batches of 3-4 competitors each. Number of batches based on total competitors (typically 3-4 batches).

3. Spawn all batch sub-agents **in a single message** (parallel). Each batch agent receives:
   - Its assigned competitors and their Trustpilot slugs
   - The scan directory path
   - Batch number for output file naming
   - Instructions to run for each competitor:
     ```bash
     node scripts/cli.mjs trustpilot scan \
       --companies <comma-separated-slugs> \
       --limit 100 \
       --maxPages 150 \
       --scan-dir /tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>
     ```
     Or if using domain lookup:
     ```bash
     node scripts/cli.mjs trustpilot scan \
       --domain "<competitor name>" \
       --limit 50 \
       --scan-dir /tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>
     ```
   - Instructions to write output to `/tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>/scan-trustpilot-batch-<N>.json`
   - Instructions to compute a `credibility` object for each review (see Per-Review Credibility Scoring below)
   - Instructions to classify each review into pain themes with severity ratings
   - Instructions to extract the following fields for raw findings passthrough on each review:
     - `authorContext`: "developer" | "founder" | "enterprise" | "hobbyist" | "unknown" — infer from review content and writing style (mentions of "our company" or "our team" = enterprise, technical jargon = developer, personal use = hobbyist)
     - `frustrationLevel`: "mild" | "blocker" | "showstopper" — infer from language intensity, star rating (1 star = likely blocker/showstopper, 2-3 stars = mild/blocker), urgency words, stated impact
     - `wtpSignal`: any mention of price, budget, "I'd pay", "worth $X", current spending, or pricing complaints (null if none found)
     - `selfPromo`: true/false — is the reviewer promoting a competing product? (check if they recommend a specific alternative they appear affiliated with)
   - Instructions to extract `demandSignals` from each review:
     ```json
     "demandSignals": {
       "volume": "any mention of quantity (e.g., '100/day', '50 agents', 'thousands of verifications') or null",
       "frequency": "daily|weekly|monthly|one-time|null",
       "pricePoint": "any mention of price/budget/spending (e.g., '$X/mo', 'currently paying $Y') or null",
       "persistentVsDisposable": "does the user need persistent dedicated resources or one-time disposable? or null"
     }
     ```
     Only populate fields where the review explicitly mentions these signals. Do NOT infer or fabricate demand data.

4. Wait for all batch files to appear: `scan-trustpilot-batch-1.json` through `scan-trustpilot-batch-N.json`

5. Read all batch files. Merge into unified output:
   - Combine all competitor review data
   - Deduplicate any reviews that appear in multiple batches
   - Aggregate pain themes across all competitors
   - Count total reviews collected per competitor

## Per-Review Credibility Scoring

Every review in the output MUST include a `credibility` object:

```json
{
  "credibility": {
    "score": 0-100,
    "tier": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
    "factors": {
      "sourceAuthority": 0-100,
      "engagement": 0-100,
      "specificity": 0-100,
      "recency": 0-100,
      "authorCredibility": 0-100
    }
  }
}
```

**Trustpilot-specific scoring rules:**
- **sourceAuthority**: Trustpilot is a verified review platform. Base = 75 for all Trustpilot reviews. Reviews on companies with 500+ total reviews = 85 (established profile). Companies with < 10 reviews = 60 (thin profile).
- **engagement**: Trustpilot reviews have limited engagement signals. Reviews marked "useful" by other users = 80; reviews with company reply = 70 (indicates the company noticed); no engagement signals = 40.
- **specificity**: Does the review mention specific features, dates, support ticket numbers, dollar amounts, or timelines? Highly specific with evidence = 90-100; moderate detail = 50-70; vague "terrible service" = 10-30.
- **recency**: Reviews within 30 days = 100; 30-90 days = 85; 90-180 days = 70; 180-365 days = 50; older = 30.
- **authorCredibility**: Verified purchase badge = 90; reviewer has 5+ reviews on Trustpilot = 75; unverified with single review = 35.

**Composite score** = weighted average: sourceAuthority 20%, engagement 10%, specificity 30%, recency 15%, authorCredibility 25%.

**Tier assignment:** HIGH >= 70, MEDIUM 40-69, LOW < 40.

Include the `credibility` object on every `painPosts` entry and on every `aggregatedThemes[].topEvidence` entry.

      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Every evidence item MUST have a `url` field. Output without URLs will be rejected by the citation pipeline.

## Mandatory URL Output Schema

Every post/evidence item in your output MUST include these fields:
- `url`: The direct, verified URL to the source (e.g., HN item URL, Reddit permalink, blog post URL)
- `sourceType`: The source platform (e.g., "hackernews", "reddit", "trustpilot", "websearch", "producthunt", "google-autocomplete")
- `title`: The title or headline of the post/page
- `date`: The publication date (ISO format if available)

For pain themes, every `evidence` array item MUST include:
```json
{
  "text": "The evidence quote or description",
  "url": "https://exact-source-url",
  "sourceType": "trustpilot",
  "date": "2026-03-28"
}
```

**URLs are NOT optional.** If you cannot determine the URL for a piece of evidence, do NOT include that evidence. An evidence item without a URL is unverifiable and therefore worthless.

For Trustpilot: URL format is `https://www.trustpilot.com/review/DOMAIN`

## Rules

- Spawn all batch sub-agents in a SINGLE message for maximum parallelism.
- Each batch sub-agent is a LEAF — it must not spawn further agents.
- If a competitor has no Trustpilot presence (0 reviews found), note it in output and move on.
- If the CLI returns an error for a company (e.g., Cloudflare block), log the error and continue with remaining companies.
- Every review quote MUST have a URL back to Trustpilot.
- Do NOT proceed to any next stage. Write your merged output file and stop.
