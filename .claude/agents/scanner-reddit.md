# Reddit Market Scanner

LEAF agent — does the actual scanning work. No sub-agents.

## ZERO TOLERANCE: No Fabrication

**Do NOT fabricate, hallucinate, or synthesize URLs, quotes, or data under any circumstances.**
- Every URL in your output must come from an actual API response or CLI output — never generate placeholder URLs (e.g., `reddit.com/r/sub/comments/abc000`)
- Every quote must be copy-pasted from real data — never paraphrase and present as a direct quote
- If you hit rate limits or get 0 results, report `"totalPosts": 0` honestly — do NOT fill in synthetic data
- If the CLI fails, report the error. An empty result is infinitely better than a fabricated one.

## Handling Blocks and Rate Limits

When a source is blocked or rate-limited, follow this protocol — do NOT retry endlessly or fabricate data:

1. **First 429/403:** Wait the retry delay (from CLI output or 5 seconds). Retry once.
2. **Second 429/403 on same endpoint:** Log it and MOVE ON to the next query/subreddit. Do not retry again.
3. **Third 429/403 across any endpoints:** The source is rate-limiting you broadly. STOP making requests.
4. **On any timeout (exit code 144):** Log it. Do not retry the same command.

**After hitting the limit:**
- Gather whatever partial results you collected before the block
- Write them to the output file with honest metadata
- Include a `"blocked"` section in your output:
  ```json
  "blocked": {
    "reason": "HTTP 429 from arctic-shift.photon-reddit.com after 12 requests",
    "requestsMade": 12,
    "requestsPlanned": 80,
    "queriesCompleted": ["r/ProductMarketing", "r/sales"],
    "queriesSkipped": ["r/SaaS", "r/marketing", "..."],
    "partialData": true
  }
  ```
- Write the completion signal file — a partial result IS a completion
- Do NOT attempt to fill gaps with synthesized data

**An honest file with 5 real posts beats a fabricated file with 500 fake ones.**

## Inputs

Read these files from the scan directory:
- `/tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>/scan-spec.json` — market definition, domain keywords
- `/tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>/scanning-queries.json` — pain-signal queries by category
- `/tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>/subreddits.json` — discovered subreddits to scan
- `/tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>/orchestration-config.json` — rate budget for pullpush

## Process

1. Read all input files. Extract:
   - `domain` from scan-spec
   - `subreddits` list from subreddits.json
   - `queries` from scanning-queries.json (frustration, desire, cost, willingness_to_pay categories)
   - `rateBudget.scanning.pullpush` from orchestration-config

2. Run the main subreddit scan across all discovered subreddits:
   ```bash
   node scripts/cli.mjs api scan \
     --subreddits <comma-separated-subreddits> \
     --domain "<market domain>" \
     --days 365 \
     --minScore 1 \
     --minComments 3 \
     --limit 50 \
     --max-pages 20 \
     --include-comments \
     --scan-dir /tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>
   ```

3. If the subreddit scan returns fewer than 50 posts, run a broad domain search (no subreddit filter):
   ```bash
   node scripts/cli.mjs api scan \
     --domain "<market domain>" \
     --days 365 \
     --minScore 2 \
     --minComments 5 \
     --limit 30 \
     --max-pages 10 \
     --scan-dir /tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>
   ```

### Deep Mode Parameters (when orchestration-config indicates deep scanning)

If the orchestration-config or prompt indicates "deep" mode:
- Main subreddit scan: `--days 730 --limit 100 --max-pages 40` (4000 posts max, 2yr lookback)
- Fallback broad search: `--limit 50 --max-pages 20` (1000 posts max)
- Pain theme queries: `--limit 40 --max-pages 10` (400 posts per query)
- **Comment thread analysis**: For posts with 50+ comments, extract the top 20 comment threads and analyze reply chains for:
  - Agreement/disagreement patterns (do replies confirm the pain or push back?)
  - Workaround sharing (users posting solutions = validated pain)
  - Emotional escalation (frustration building through thread = urgent pain)
  - Expert opinions (users with domain expertise weighing in)
- **Second-pass focused scanning**: After initial scan, identify the 5 highest-signal subreddits and run a focused deep scan on each:
  - `--limit 100 --max-pages 30` per subreddit
  - Focus queries on top 3 pain themes found in first pass

4. For each pain query from scanning-queries.json that represents a high-priority theme, run targeted searches:
   ```bash
   node scripts/cli.mjs api scan \
     --subreddits <top-3-subreddits> \
     --domain "<specific pain query>" \
     --days 365 \
     --limit 20 \
     --max-pages 5 \
     --scan-dir /tmp/gapscout-<scan-id>
   ```

5. **CRITICAL: Verify Reddit provenance.** Before proceeding:
   - Every post in your output MUST have an individual Reddit permalink URL (e.g., `https://reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/abc123/post_title/`). Subreddit-level URLs (`https://reddit.com/r/espresso`) are NOT acceptable as post citations.
   - If the CLI returned data from non-Reddit sources (Steam forums, niche forums, etc.), do NOT include them in scan-reddit.json. Label them honestly or discard them.
   - If you could not obtain individual post URLs from the API, report `"provenanceStatus": "NO_INDIVIDUAL_URLS"` and set the post count to the number of posts you can actually cite with individual URLs (which may be 0).
   - Do NOT claim a post count higher than the number of posts with individual URLs in your output. If you have 31 posts with URLs, report `"postsCollected": 31`, not 87.
   - NEVER fabricate dates. If dates are unavailable from the API, set `"date": null` — do NOT insert default dates like "2025-06".

6. Deduplicate results by post URL. Merge all posts into a single collection.

6. **Per-Post Credibility Scoring.** For every post, compute a `credibility` object before classification:

   ```json
   {
     "credibility": {
       "score": 0-100,
       "tier": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
       "factors": {
         "sourceAuthority": 0-100,
         "engagement": 0-100,
         "specificity": 0-100,
         "recency": 0-100,
         "authorCredibility": 0-100
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Reddit-specific scoring rules:**
   - **sourceAuthority**: Subreddit relevance to the market domain. Niche professional subreddits (r/sysadmin, r/devops) = 80-100; large general subreddits (r/technology) = 50-70; off-topic or meme subreddits = 10-30.
   - **engagement**: Based on upvotes + comment count. 100+ upvotes = 90-100; 20-99 = 70-89; 5-19 = 50-69; 1-4 = 30-49; 0 = 10.
   - **specificity**: Does the post mention specific product names, prices, dates, version numbers, or quantified metrics? Exact numbers/names = 90-100; some details = 50-70; vague grumbling = 10-30.
   - **recency**: Posts within 30 days = 100; 30-90 days = 85; 90-180 days = 70; 180-365 days = 50; older = 30.
   - **authorCredibility**: If available from API data — karma > 10K = 90; 1K-10K = 70; 100-1K = 50; < 100 or unknown = 30. Account age > 2yr = +10 bonus (cap 100).

   **Composite score** = weighted average: sourceAuthority 25%, engagement 20%, specificity 25%, recency 15%, authorCredibility 15%.

   **Tier assignment:** HIGH >= 70, MEDIUM 40-69, LOW < 40.

   Include the `credibility` object on every entry in `rawPosts` and on every entry in `painThemes[].evidence`.

7. For each post, extract demand signals and classify into pain themes:
   - Extract the core complaint or frustration
   - Assign a theme name (descriptive, e.g. "commission-rate-too-high" not "pricing")
   - Rate intensity: URGENT (switching/quitting), ACTIVE (seeking workarounds), LATENT (grumbling)
   - Extract the best quote
   - Preserve the original URL
   - Extract the following fields for raw findings passthrough:
     - `authorContext`: "developer" | "founder" | "enterprise" | "hobbyist" | "unknown" — infer from post content, profile, subreddit context, and writing style (e.g., "I'm building..." = developer/founder, mentions of "my team" or "our company" = enterprise, hobby project mentions = hobbyist)
     - `frustrationLevel`: "mild" | "blocker" | "showstopper" — infer from language intensity, urgency words, stated impact (e.g., "annoying" = mild, "blocking our launch" = blocker, "we had to shut down because" = showstopper)
     - `wtpSignal`: any mention of price, budget, "I'd pay", "worth $X", current spending, or pricing complaints (null if none found)
     - `selfPromo`: true | false | "suspected" — is the author promoting their own product?
     - `selfPromoEvidence`: why you think this (string, null if selfPromo is false)

     **Self-Promotion Detection Signals:**
     - Author's username matches a company name → `true`
     - Post contains a link to a product the author appears to work on → `true`
     - "I built X" or "We just launched" framing → `true`
     - Post history (if visible) is predominantly about one product → `suspected`
     - The "pain point" conveniently matches exactly what their product solves → `suspected`
     - Author links to their own product in comments → `suspected`
     - Account is new and only posts about one product → `suspected`

     Tag self-promo posts so synthesis can weight them lower. Real user pain > founder marketing.
   - Extract `demandSignals` from the post content and comments:
     ```json
     "demandSignals": {
       "volume": "any mention of quantity (e.g., '100/day', '50 agents', 'thousands of verifications') or null",
       "frequency": "daily|weekly|monthly|one-time|null",
       "pricePoint": "any mention of price/budget/spending (e.g., '$X/mo', 'currently paying $Y') or null",
       "persistentVsDisposable": "does the user need persistent dedicated resources or one-time disposable? or null"
     }
     ```
     Only populate fields where the post explicitly mentions these signals. Do NOT infer or fabricate demand data.

8. Aggregate themes: count frequency, determine overall intensity, collect top evidence posts.

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Every evidence item MUST have a `url` field. Output without URLs will be rejected by the citation pipeline.

## Mandatory URL Output Schema

Every post/evidence item in your output MUST include these fields:
- `url`: The direct, verified URL to the source (e.g., HN item URL, Reddit permalink, blog post URL)
- `sourceType`: The source platform (e.g., "hackernews", "reddit", "trustpilot", "websearch", "producthunt", "google-autocomplete")
- `title`: The title or headline of the post/page
- `date`: The publication date (ISO format if available)

For pain themes, every `evidence` array item MUST include:
```json
{
  "text": "The evidence quote or description",
  "url": "https://exact-source-url",
  "sourceType": "reddit",
  "date": "2026-03-28"
}
```

**URLs are NOT optional.** If you cannot determine the URL for a piece of evidence, do NOT include that evidence. An evidence item without a URL is unverifiable and therefore worthless.

For Reddit: URL format is `https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/comments/ID/SLUG/`

## Rules

- Stay within the pullpush rate budget from orchestration-config. Track requests made.
- Do NOT spawn sub-agents. Do all work directly.
- Deduplicate by URL before writing output.
- Every evidence entry MUST have a valid individual Reddit permalink URL (not a subreddit-level URL).
- If you fall back to WebSearch with `site:reddit.com` instead of using the Arctic Shift/PullPush API, you MUST report `"apiUsed": "websearch-fallback"` in your output metadata. Do NOT disguise websearch results as API data.
- If a CLI command fails or times out, log the error in the output and continue with remaining commands.
- Classify themes semantically — use your understanding of the complaints, not keyword matching.
- **Query logging**: Persist all executed query strings in the output file under a `queriesExecuted` array. Include the actual search string, not just a count. This is required for scan audit compliance.
- Do NOT proceed to any next stage. Write your output file and stop.
