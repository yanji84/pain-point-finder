# GapScout

Market intelligence engine that maps competitors, mines weaknesses across 11+ sources, identifies whitespace, and scores opportunities.

## Quick Start

```
/gapscout [market name or description]
```

Examples:
- `/gapscout pokemon TCG market`
- `/gapscout project management tools`
- `/gapscout Jira, Asana, Linear, Monday`
- `/gapscout` (no input → suggests markets from HN frontpage)

## Team LinkedIn Connections (Optional)

Upload your team's LinkedIn connections via the web UI for personalized outreach suggestions in every report.

1. Export your connections from LinkedIn ([instructions](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a566336))
2. Log in to GapScout → click **Connections** in the nav bar
3. Enter your name and upload the CSV
4. Repeat for each team member

Connections are stored persistently — upload once, every scan uses them automatically. The pipeline will:
- Auto-export team connections to each new scan directory
- Parse and merge all team members' connections
- Match connections to competitor companies and target personas
- Generate "Network Reach" sections in the report with specific outreach suggestions

Privacy: Connection data stored in the local SQLite database only. Never sent to external APIs.

## Architecture

The `/gapscout` skill spawns the **orchestrator agent** (`.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`) which coordinates the entire pipeline. Default mode is **iterative draft** — a lean first pass refined through critique→debate→improve cycles.

### Iterative Draft Mode (default)

```
orchestrator (single brain, owns all stage transitions)
  ├── planner (4 research sub-agents)
  ├── discovery team (4 coordinators, each with sub-teams)
  ├── trust-scorer (4 dimension sub-agents)
  ├── connection-indexer (optional — if team LinkedIn CSVs provided)
  ├── scanner team (all sources in parallel + broadening loop)
  ├── citation-watchdog (background — validates data as it appears)
  ├── LEAN synthesis (6 core sprints: map → pain → needs → switching → gaps → scoring)
  ├── citation verification (5 parallel verifiers)
  ├── draft report v1
  └── ITERATIVE REFINEMENT LOOP (max 3 iterations):
      ├── report-critic (5 parallel sub-teams: evidence, perspective, bias, competitors, counter-evidence)
      ├── debate-agent (parallel bull/bear pairs per top opportunity)
      ├── strategic-reviewer (parallel strategist per opportunity — CEO lens)
      ├── improvement-planner (targeted action plan)
      ├── targeted re-scan + re-synthesize + citation expansion
      ├── report v(N+1)
      ├── loop-controller (converge or continue?)
      └── iteration-journal (appends human-readable record)

Resume mode: previous report → draft v0 → enters loop at critique step
```

### Full Single-Pass Mode (set `iterativeMode.enabled: false`)

```
orchestrator
  ├── planner → discovery → judge/documenter QA
  ├── scanner team → judge/documenter QA
  ├── synthesizer (15 sequential sprints)
  ├── deep-research-verifier (max 3 rounds)
  ├── judge/documenter QA (with iteration loop)
  ├── citation verification → report generators
  └── delta-summarizer (resume mode only)
```

~225 agents per scan. Peak concurrency ~50-60 during scanning.
