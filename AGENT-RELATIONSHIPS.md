### Resume Mode Entry Point

```
RESUME MODE: previous scan → scan-resumption (copy + baseline) → enters iterative loop at CRITIQUE
```

When resuming from an existing report, the `scan-resumption` agent copies previous scan files into the new workspace and writes `resumption-baseline.json`. The pipeline then enters the iterative refinement loop (Section 5C) at the critique step, treating the previous report as draft v0.

| `citation-expansion-iter-{N}-{idx}.json` | citation search agents | report generator, synthesizer | Iteration N |
| `refutation-iter-{N}-{idx}.json` | refutation agents | synthesizer (re-run) | Iteration N |
| `broadened-profile-iter-{N}-{slug}.json` | adhoc profiler agents | synthesizer Sprint 1 (re-run) | Iteration N |
| `strategic-review-round-{N}.json` | strategic-reviewer | improvement-planner, loop-controller, iteration-journal | Iteration N |
| `iteration-journal.md` | iteration-journal | user (chat reference) | All iterations |
| `resumption-baseline.json` | scan-resumption | improvement-planner, report-critic | Resume entry |

Note: In resume mode, `scan-resumption` copies all previous scan files into the new workspace and writes `resumption-baseline.json`. These files feed into the iterative refinement loop (not a separate pipeline).

## 4. Context Reset Boundaries

Context resets occur at every major stage boundary and between every synthesis sprint. Agents on opposite sides of a reset boundary NEVER share in-context messages; all data passes through files.

```
PLANNING ──file──> [CONTEXT RESET] ──file──> DISCOVERY

### Where SendMessage IS Used (Within a Stage)

| Within Stage | Who Sends | Who Receives | Content |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Scanning | Any scanner sub-agent | scan-orchestrator | `NEW_COMPETITOR: <name> \| <context>` |
| Scanning | profiler-batch-N | profile-scraper coordinator | `NEW_COMPETITOR_SURFACED: <name>` |
| QA | documenter | team lead | Stage summary (issue counts, verdict, recommendation) |

### Where File-Based Handoff Replaces SendMessage

| Boundary | Instead of SendMessage... | Agents use file... |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Judge -> Documenter | Judge does NOT send evaluation via message | Judge writes `judge-<stage>-COMPLETE.json`; documenter polls for `judge-<stage>-READY.txt` |
| Sprint N -> Sprint N+1 | Sprint N does NOT send output to Sprint N+1 | Sprint N writes `synthesis-N-READY.txt`; Sprint N+1 reads from file |
| Stage -> Next Stage | Current stage does NOT send outputs to next stage | Current stage writes `stage-complete-<stage>.json`; next stage reads artifacts list from file |
| Judge -> Synthesizer (iteration) | Judge does NOT send feedback via message | Judge writes `judge-feedback-round-N.json`; synthesizer reads from file |

                                           |
                                           v

                                                to documenter
```

**Configuration:**
- Max iterations: 3 (from scan-spec.json `synthesisSpec.maxIterationRounds`)
- Feedback file: `/tmp/gapscout-<id>/judge-feedback-round-<N>.json`
- Re-run scope: only failing sprints + sprints that depend on them
- At max iterations: proceed with best available output, note weaknesses

**Which sprints can be re-run:**

| Sprint | Can be re-run? | Triggers re-run of... |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Yes | Sprints 2, 3, 5, 6 (all depend on competitive map) |
| 2 | Yes | Sprints 3, 4, 5, 6 (all depend on competitor pain) |
| 3 | Yes | Sprints 4, 5, 6 |
| 4 | Yes | Sprints 5, 6 |
| 5 | Yes | Sprint 6 |
| 6 | Yes | Sprint 7 |
| 7 | Yes | None (terminal) |

### 5B. Gap-Analyst Judge-Driven Iteration

```
gap-analyst completes report
        |
        v
  judge evaluates
        |
   MARGINAL/FAIL
        |
        v
  judge writes judge-feedback-round-N.json
        |
        v
  gap-analyst reads feedback, re-writes ONLY failing sections:
    - Citation grounding <8/10: find 2+ source quotes per claim
    - Pain depth <7/10: ask "why?" 3 times deeper
    - Specificity <7/10: replace "users" with named segments
    - Cross-source <8/10: only promote 3+ source claims
        |
        v
  judge re-evaluates (round N+1)
        |
  Max 3 rounds, then ship with weakness note
```

### 5C. Outer Iterative Refinement Loop (Iterative Draft Mode)

```
                   LEAN DRAFT (6 sprints)
                          |
                          v
                   DRAFT REPORT v1

    └── selective sprint re-runs
              |
              v
    CITATION RE-VERIFICATION (5 parallel)
              |
              v
    REGENERATE REPORT v(N+1)
              |
              v

    CONTINUE     STOP
       |           |
    loop to       SHIP
    critique
```

**Resume mode enters this loop with the previous report as draft v0.**
The `scan-resumption` agent copies files and writes `resumption-baseline.json`.
The `improvement-planner` reads `resumption-baseline.json` to understand what
data already exists. The critic red-teams the existing report as-is.

**Per-iteration agent counts:**

| Agent | Count per iteration | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| report-critic | 1 coordinator | |
| critique sub-agents | 5 | parallel |
| debate-agent | 1 coordinator | |
| bull/bear/verdict agents | 15 | 3 per opportunity × 5 |
| improvement-planner | 1 | leaf |
| targeted search agents | 5-15 | varies by plan |
| citation expansion agents | 3-5 | varies by gaps |
| refutation agents | 2-5 | varies by hypotheses |
| new competitor profilers | 0-5 | only if critic finds gaps |
| synthesizer-coordinator (re-run) | 1 | only re-runs affected sprints |
| citation verifiers | 5 | mandatory |
| report generators | 2 | JSON + HTML |
| loop-controller | 1 | leaf |
| strategic-reviewer | 1 coordinator | |
| opportunity-strategist agents | up to 5 | parallel |
| iteration-journal | 1 | leaf, runs in background |
| **Subtotal per iteration** | **~45-65** | |

**Total across 3 iterations: ~135-195 additional agents**

**Convergence criteria (ALL must be true to STOP):**
- Critique score < 25
- Max opportunity score change < 5
- No new opportunities in top 10
- No CRITICAL findings
- New evidence rate < 10%
- OR max iterations reached (hard stop)

**Continue criteria (ANY triggers CONTINUE):**
- Any CRITICAL critique finding unaddressed
- Any top-5 opportunity with LOW confidence
- Citation coverage < 70%
- A top-5 opportunity lost its debate (BEAR won)
- New evidence rate > 30%

**Deferred sprint pull-in rules:**
| Critic flags... | Pull in sprint... |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Weak evidence quality | Sprint 8 (signal strength) |
| Missing competitive moat analysis | Sprint 9 (counter-positioning) |
| No market forecast | Sprint 10 (consolidation forecast) |
| Missing leadership context | Sprint 11 (founder profiles) |
| No validation plan | Sprint 12 (community validation) |
| Missed pain signals | Sprint 7 (false-negative rescue) |

### 5D. Stage-Level Re-Run (Team Lead Decision)

When a judge returns `blockerForNextStage: true`:
- Team lead reviews the blocker reason
- May re-run specific sources (e.g., re-run reddit-competitor-scanner with adjusted queries)
- May acknowledge degraded data and proceed
- This is NOT automatic -- requires team lead judgment

---

- 30 competitors discovered
- Regular depth

### 6B. Total Agent Count

**Iterative Draft Mode (default):**

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Planning | 5 |
| Discovery | 25 |
| Scanning | 129 |
| Scan Audit | 1 |
| Lean Synthesis (6 sprints) | 14 |
| Citation Verification | 5 |
| Draft Report | 2 |
| Iterative Loop (×3 iterations) | ~120-180 |
| Final Report + Summary | 2 |
| **TOTAL** | **~300-360** |

**Full Single-Pass Mode:**

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Planning | 5 |
| Discovery | 25 |
| QA: Discovery | 11 |
| Scanning | 129 |
| QA: Scanning | 23 |
| Synthesis (15 sprints) | 17 |
| QA: Synthesis | 15 |
| **TOTAL** | **~225** |

If judge iteration loops trigger (assume 1 round of re-runs):
- Re-run 2 sprints + downstream: +8 synthesis agents
- Re-run judge + documenter: +15 QA agents
- **Total with 1 iteration round: ~248**

### 6C. Peak Concurrent Agents

| Stage | Peak Concurrency | When |
|-------|-----------------|------|
| Planning | 4 | All 4 planner sub-agents running |
| Discovery | ~18 | All 4 coordinators active, each with parallel sub-teams |
| QA: Discovery | ~9 | judge eval sub-agents + documenter observer sub-agents |
| **Scanning** | **~50-60** | **All Category A/B scanners + broadening loop at peak** |
| QA: Scanning | ~19 | judge eval sub-agents (most files to evaluate) |
| Synthesis | 3 | Max parallel within any single sprint |
| QA: Synthesis | ~13 | judge eval sub-agents for 7 sprints + validators |

**Peak concurrent agents across entire pipeline: ~50-60** (during the Scanning stage when all original scanners are active, broadening agents are spawning for newly discovered competitors, and multiple batch agents are running within each coordinator).

## Appendix A: Orchestration Model

**The orchestrator is the single brain.** All other agents follow a "Completion Protocol" — they write output files + a completion signal, then exit. They do NOT spawn downstream agents.

```
                    orchestrator (the ONLY agent that spawns stage transitions)
                         |
         reads completion signals + QA verdicts at each boundary
                         |
        makes runtime decisions: adjust agent counts, skip sources,
        retry failures, manage iteration loops, present final results
                         |
    ┌────────┬───────────┼───────────┬──────────┬──────────────┐
    v        v           v           v          v              v
 planner  discovery   judge/doc   scanning   synthesizer   report-gen
           team                    team      coordinator     team
    │        │           │           │          │              │
    └────────┴───────────┴───────────┴──────────┴──────────────┘
              all report completion via files, NOT auto-proceed
```

**Before the orchestrator**: Agents used "Auto-Proceed" — each agent blindly spawned the next stage without knowing the full topology. This was waterfall with no runtime adaptation.

**With the orchestrator**: One agent sees the whole picture, reads QA results, adjusts agent counts, skips broken sources, and manages the iteration loop. Agents focus on their job and report completion.
